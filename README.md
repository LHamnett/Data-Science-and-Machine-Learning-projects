# Data-Science-Projects
Repo showing some of the data science projects I have done including preprocessing and supervised learning.

We have the preprocessing folder and supervised learning folder.

In the preprocessing folder we have:

1. Create_shuffled_train_val_split_for_image_datasets - shuffling and combining a number of different image datasets into training and validation splits
2. Data_preparation_feature_analysis_star_ratings_sklearn - Using **big data methodologies** (such as dask and c++) to process a large amount of data as efficiently as possible, clean it, combine it and then save it in a suitable format
3. Energy_price_data_preprocessing - gathering data from a number of different excel files and performing a number of **preprocessing** steps to get the data into a single cleaned dataframe. 

In the supervised learning folder we have:

1. Fraud_classification_sklearn - Comparing different **classification algorithms** to see if an individual is a person of interest in the Enron company legal case for fraud.
2. Employee_leave_logistic_regression_sklearn - A **logistic regression using sklearn** to predict for scheduling reasons whether an employee would take a large amount of time away from the office for a certain absence reason.
3. Road_safety_regression_prediction_ensemble_sklearn - Road-safety score prediction using **regression methods and ensemble learning**. Comparison of different regression models and ensemble methods to predict the road safety score (1 star - 5 stars) of a road given a set of road features.
4. Energy_price_model_selection_optimisation_sklearn_optuna - Loads data, automatically compares a number of different **regression models** for predicting energy prices, chooses the best model and applies **automated hyperparameter tuning** , then **visualises* the results of the tuned model on a test set.
