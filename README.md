# Data-Science-Projects
Repo showing some of the data science projects I have done including preprocessing and supervised learning.

We have the preprocessing folder and supervised learning folder.

In the preprocessing folder we have:

1. Create_shuffled_train_val_split_for_image_datasets - shuffling and combining a number of different image datasets into training and validation splits
2. Data_preparation_feature_analysis_star_ratings_sklearn - Using big data methodologies (such as dask and c++) to process a large amount of data as efficiently as possible, clean it, combine it and then save it in a suitable format

In the supervised learning folder we have:

1. Fraud_classification_sklearn - Comparing different classification algorithms to see if an individual is a person of interest in the Enron company legal case for fraud.
2. Employee_leave_logistic_regression_sklearn - A logistic regression using sklearn to predict for scheduling reasons whether an employee would take a large amount of time away from the office for a certain absence reason.
3. Audiobook_marketing_prediction_tensorflow - A deep neural network created using tensorflow to predict whether a customer using an audiobooks platform is likely to 'convert' or be a repeat customer in the future. This would allow the company to use targeted advertising to focus on maximising revenue from customers who are likely to return in the future, rather than 'wasting' the marketing budget by targeting users unlikely to be a repeat customer.
4. Road_safety_regression_prediction_ensemble_sklearn - Road-safety score prediction using regression methods and ensemble learning. Comparison of different regression models and ensemble methods to predict the road safety score (1 star - 5 stars) of a road given a set of road features
