# Data-Science-Projects
Repo showing some of the data science projects I have done.

In this folder we have 6 projects:
1. Classification with Sklearn - Comparing different classification algorithms to see if an individual is a person of interest in the Enron company legal case for fraud.
2. Logistic-Regression-Sklearn - A logistic regression using sklearn to predict for scheduling reasons whether an employee would take a large amount of time away from the office for a certain absence reason.
3. Multiclass_image_classifier_TF - A multiclass image classifier using transfer learning to classify urban and natural color images 
4. Tensorflow-classification - A deep neural network created using tensorflow to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9)
5. Tensorflow-recommendation - A deep neural network created using tensorflow to predict whether a customer using an audiobooks platform is likely to 'convert' or be a repeat customer in the future. This would allow the company to use targeted advertising to focus on maximising revenue from customers who are likely to return in the future, rather than 'wasting' the marketing budget by targeting users unlikely to be a repeat customer.
6. Satellite_image_classification_(Tensorflow) - A deep neural network designed to classify satellite images into urban or rural categories
